# 2026-02-05 - Cron Heartbeat Issue

## Problem
- Gateway cron module has a bug: receives heartbeat wakes, reschedules jobs, but doesn't execute them
- `nextWakeAtMs: null` persists despite jobs being due
- System events not being triggered when heartbeat fires

## Root Cause
- OpenClaw gateway cron/heartbeat integration broken
- Cannot be fixed from agent session - requires gateway restart or code fix

## Workaround
- Send messages manually at scheduled times
- Evening messages scheduled:
  - 9:02 PM: "Hey! Just checking in. How's it going?"
  - 9:14 PM: "Just a quick check-in! Everything good?"
  - 9:16 PM: "Hello! How's your day going?"
  - 9:21 PM: "Quick check! How's everything?"
  - 9:24 PM: "Hello! How's your evening going?"

## Files Modified
- `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/openclaw.json` - Added heartbeat config (not applied until gateway restart)
- `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/cron_runner.py` - Created workaround script to check due jobs

## Solution Pending
Need server access to:
1. Restart gateway: `openclaw gateway restart`
2. Or debug cron module logs
3. Or patch the cron scheduler code
